			 <p>When you&rsquo;re vibe coding a project, don&rsquo;t forget these tips:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clear the context window occasionally. Start with a fresh agent.</li>
<li>Be clear in your intent. Use examples often.</li>
<li>Be ruthless about refactoring, either on your own or with the agent&rsquo;s help. Agents can quickly create spaghetti code.</li>

			 <p>There’s an itch I’ve been meaning to scratch for the better part of 15 years now. And among job, family, and let’s face it, lack of motivation, I’ve never been able to get anywhere near to creating my own iOS app that I could call my own and share on the App Store. Until now.</p>
<p>Firstly, let’s set the <a href="https://rockyandbullwinkle.fandom.com/wiki/WABAC_machine">WABAC machine</a> for 15 years ago: I considered myself a somewhat competent back-end developer, and I wanted to create an app but had zero experience. This was in the early days of online learning. If there was Pluralsight or LinkedIn Learning (née Lynda Learning) around, I certainly wasn’t aware of them at the time. But I had a Mac and there was plenty of documentation online detailing how to create your own app. At the time, Swift didn’t exist. It was all Objective-C, which I objectively hated. I’m not blaming the language or framework. Rather, I lacked the patience and wherewithal to truly immerse myself in it. So the iOS app remained a dream and nothing more.</p>
<p>As the years passed, I had fits and starts of trying to master the Webview frameworks: those that allow you to create a web app using Javascript and/or Typescript. Then, you click a button and, magically, an iOS and Android app are born from your code. Examples include Ionic, Phonegap, etc. These were definitely more in my wheelhouse, but getting the UI to appear and behave exactly the way I wanted by way of generating code was simply too much work.</p>
<p>Again, I have only myself to blame. I just lacked the time and mental fortitude to figure it all out. I mean: spending hours searching Stack Overflow in order to figure out how to get this button to appear in the correct way, hiding that control when focus was on such-and-such an input? And write tests for all this? I admire the thousands of developers out there who have mastered it all. There are truly some beautifully designed apps out there. But for me: forget it. I was built of weaker stuff.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the current moment: AI coding agents. Of course I had used Copilot in VS Code and had heard of the benefits of IDEs like Cursor, but nothing really drove me to try it all out. That is until past-me was smart enough to attend a tech talk at work introducing us all on how to leverage an agent to generate code for you at the project level.</p>
<p>I’m not talking about going into ChatGPT and asking it to create a function to sort some integers, or parse a date. Instead, I’m telling the agent: “You are a senior engineer in charge of designing an app that does x, y, and z. Generate 1-point stories for the project that junior engineers can use to create the app all the way to deploying it to production.”</p>
<p>Could I use this technique to create that iOS app I’ve been meaning to do all this time? It felt like cheating. Alot. I don’t know a lick of SwiftUI and I am not up on the latest iOS design specs and best practices. On the other hand, I also knew that life is short. This was something I really wanted to do. I concluded that as long as I was honest with myself and others about where my own human efforts ended and the AI-generated code started, then this was still a good effort and ought to be fun. And it was.</p>
<p>So I humbly introduce my first iOS app: Prime Number Finder. It’s a simple app that tells you if a number is prime or not. That’s it. Couldn’t have done it (at all) without Cursor and Claude, my two coding buddies.</p>
<p>If you’re curious, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-prime-number-finder/id6741829020">download</a> it from the App Store, try it out, and please leave any feedback, positive or negative. I’ve already started an <a href="https://github.com/ahl-gram/PrimeFinder/issues">issue list</a> in GitHub as there’s a lot more I’d like to add.</p>
<p>Oh, and this blog post is 100% written by me. Pinky swear. So, thank you for reading!</p>

			 <p>As a software engineering leader, my role often feels like a balancing act: juggling technical challenges, team dynamics, and quarterly objectives - all while trying to ensure the team feels supported, empowered, and safe. In the middle of all this, it’s easy to fall into the trap of wanting to fix every problem that comes my way. But what if the most impactful thing to do isn’t to fix anything at all, but to listen?</p>
<p>Active listening is a skill that transforms how you lead. It’s not just about hearing words, it’s about empathizing with the emotions, concerns, and ideas behind them. When listening, and <em>not</em> interrupting to offer a solution right away, you create a space where your team feels heard. This fosters trust, encourages collaboration, and improves morale. Oftentimes, the best ideas can come from the people closest to the problem.</p>
<p>Here’s the hard part: resist the urge to jump in and fix things. You got to listen to your team! As engineers, we’re hard-wired to solve problems, many times immediately. But when you offer solutions without listening to others' concerns, you risk shutting down creativity or making your team feel like their input isn’t valued. In other words, let them finish. When you feel it’s the right time to speak, try asking open-ended questions like, “what do you think the next step should be?” or “how can I support you in this?” This empowers your team and gives them confidence that they’re truly being heard.</p>
<p>Active listening also helps you uncover the root of issues. Sometimes, what seems like a technical problem is actually a communication gap, a misalignment of priorities, or even a personal challenge. By listening deeply, you can address the real problem, not just the symptoms. So, the next time a team member comes to you with a challenge, pause. Resist the urge to interrupt and fix. Listen with curiosity and empathy. You might be surprised at how much more effective, and connected, your leadership becomes.</p>

<li>Dash cam</li>
<li>Upgraded stereo to take advantage of Apple Car play</li>
<li>New backup cam (old one was not working correctly)</li>
<li>New lift gate switch because the Florida sun literally melted the old one.</li>

			 <p>🎂 🎂 🎂 Here we are: the big 5-oh. I asked ChatGPT to create a light but heartfelt post for me, but all I got out of that exercise was generic and saccharine outputs about how “50 is the new 30” (news to me), and how I’m looking forward to new adventures… blah blah blah. Plus, way too many birthday cake emojis.</p>
<p>Despite the milestone, it’s true that I’m feeling upbeat. I’m grateful for my beautiful family and life’s blessings. But the general tone of the ChatGPT responses - shockingly - reeked of AI. So I’m going to have to do this the hard way: write this post myself without the help of an AI assistant. Like an animal.</p>
<p>Let’s start with some perspective. Here’s some fun and interesting things that happened by the close of 1974:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nixon resigned as US president.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rubik’s Cube was invented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 closed at 68.56.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Dow closed at 616.24.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was born.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a funny line in “A Christmas Story” where Ralphie describes the feeling of time running out as “the Christmas noose beginning to tighten”. Turning 50 is kind of like that. My “time-left-to-do-stuff&quot; noose is beginning to tighten. Wait, that sounded darker than I intended. What I’m trying to say is that it’s a weird feeling knowing that I’m now older than my father was when I, as a kid, first realized he was OLD.</p>
<p>This being the age of electronic communication, I had a whole conversation with my extended family - over text - about how 50 is middle age (again, news to me). This is ridiculous given that the average lifespan in the US is around 80. The actuaries would say I’m well past middle-age. But I think the sentiment with my family was more complex than merely taking my expected lifespan and dividing it by two. Most of us, regardless of what the calendar says, feel like we’re perpetually in middle age. We’re constantly “adulting”: managing family, job, our homes, hobbies, our health, and unexpected life events.</p>
<p>Some of these unexpected life events can permanently change your perspective on your life. My wife’s cancer journey really drove that point home for me: Life is short. Yeah, no kidding. My advice: don’t just sit on your ass too long. Thing’s aren’t as good or as bad as you think.</p>
<p>Bill Burr said it best: “You’re gonna be fine. And even if you’re not, isn’t it better to exist thinking it’s going to be fine until it’s not? And then, you can handle it then. There’s no sense in ruining right now.”</p>
<p>Indeed. Enjoy right now. So, here’s to the next actuarially-adjusted 50 years.</p>
<p>Cheers and salud.</p>

			 <p>The other day I did something I never thought I would end up doing: I called Amazon support. Apparently, one of my kids inadvertently signed up for an Amazon Music subscription (yes, those apparently exist). I called the number after trying to resolve the issue online and getting nowhere. My expectations were pretty much nonexistent. But I gotta say, after explaining the situation, Amazon support was extremely helpful and resolved the issue. Not only that, but I was refunded as well.</p>

			 <p>Book recommendation and leap day are a great combination! Here&rsquo;s one that I recently read. Camille Fournier lays out the path in a way engineers and other tech workers will find easy to understand (trust me, if I was able to understand it, anyone can). I will be re-reading this again very soon. 👍🏻</p>

			 <p>A so-called financial columnist was recently scammed out of $50k in one of those &ldquo;shoe-box&rdquo; scams. There are entire YouTube channels dedicated to exposing this problem. The scam involves elaborate coordination across countries and continents. The complexity probably rivals that of some illegal drug organizations.</p>
<p>More here: <a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/living/video/financial-columnist-speaks-after-losing-50k-scam-107359624">www.goodmorningamerica.com/living/vi&hellip;</a></p>
<p>3 things I&rsquo;d like to add to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I am NOT a financial nor a security expert. I am a person on the internet who merely has a passing interest in both subjects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please be very selective in who you take advice from, especially if they claim to be a &ldquo;journalist expert”. This is not meant to criticize journalists in general. Some of these people do amazing work, sometimes risking their lives. And many are indeed experts in money and finance. But it appears that, at least in this space, there is not enough accountability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please check on your family members who might not be very, er, &ldquo;tech savvy&rdquo;. Particularly elderly relatives. Elderly people in English-speaking countries are particularly easy targets for these types of scams.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Jake Kepins has a great summary over on Threads about the &ldquo;expert journalist&rdquo; as well. Worth the read.

			 <p>The selection of music on Apple Music compared to Spotify continues to disappoint. I already pay for the service via iCloud+. I have heard others describe the sound quality as being superior. I WANT to like it and use it. But until I can import my HIGHLY CURATED playlists from Spotify to Apple Music without a significant fraction of tracks being dropped on the floor, I will continue to use (and pay extra for) Spotify.</p>
