			 <p>üéÇ üéÇ üéÇ Here we are: the big 5-oh. I asked ChatGPT to create a light but heartfelt post for me, but all I got out of that exercise was generic and saccharine outputs about how ‚Äú50 is the new 30‚Äù (news to me), and how I‚Äôm looking forward to new adventures‚Ä¶ blah blah blah. Plus, way too many birthday cake emojis.</p>
<p>Despite the milestone, it‚Äôs true that I‚Äôm feeling upbeat. I‚Äôm grateful for my beautiful family and life‚Äôs blessings. But the general tone of the ChatGPT responses - shockingly - reeked of AI. So I‚Äôm going to have to do this the hard way: write this post myself without the help of an AI assistant. Like an animal.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs start with some perspective. Here‚Äôs some fun and interesting things that happened by the close of 1974:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nixon resigned as US president.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rubik‚Äôs Cube was invented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 closed at 68.56.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Dow closed at 616.24.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was born.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There‚Äôs a funny line in ‚ÄúA Christmas Story‚Äù where Ralphie describes the feeling of time running out as ‚Äúthe Christmas noose beginning to tighten‚Äù. Turning 50 is kind of like that. My ‚Äútime-left-to-do-stuff&quot; noose is beginning to tighten. Wait, that sounded darker than I intended. What I‚Äôm trying to say is that it‚Äôs a weird feeling knowing that I‚Äôm now older than my father was when I, as a kid, first realized he was OLD.</p>
<p>This being the age of electronic communication, I had a whole conversation with my extended family - over text - about how 50 is middle age (again, news to me). This is ridiculous given that the average lifespan in the US is around 80. The actuaries would say I‚Äôm well past middle-age. But I think the sentiment with my family was more complex than merely taking my expected lifespan and dividing it by two. Most of us, regardless of what the calendar says, feel like we‚Äôre perpetually in middle age. We‚Äôre constantly ‚Äúadulting‚Äù: managing family, job, our homes, hobbies, our health, and unexpected life events.</p>
<p>Some of these unexpected life events can permanently change your perspective on your life. My wife‚Äôs cancer journey really drove that point home for me: Life is short. Yeah, no kidding. My advice: don‚Äôt just sit on your ass too long. Thing‚Äôs aren‚Äôt as good or as bad as you think.</p>
<p>Bill Burr said it best: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna be fine. And even if you‚Äôre not, isn‚Äôt it better to exist thinking it‚Äôs going to be fine until it‚Äôs not? And then, you can handle it then. There‚Äôs no sense in ruining right now.‚Äù</p>
<p>Indeed. Enjoy right now. So, here‚Äôs to the next actuarially-adjusted 50 years.</p>
<p>Cheers and salud.</p>

My expectations were pretty much nonexistent. But I gotta say, after explaining the situation, Amazon support was extremely helpful and resolved the issue. Not only that, but I was refunded as well.</p>

			 <p>A so-called financial columnist was recently scammed out of $50k in one of those &ldquo;shoe-box&rdquo; scams. There are entire YouTube channels dedicated to exposing this problem. The scam involves elaborate coordination across countries and continents. The complexity probably rivals that of some illegal drug organizations.</p>
<p>More here: <a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/living/video/financial-columnist-speaks-after-losing-50k-scam-107359624">www.goodmorningamerica.com/living/vi&hellip;</a></p>
<p>3 things I&rsquo;d like to add to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I am NOT a financial nor a security expert. I am a person on the internet who merely has a passing interest in both subjects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please be very selective in who you take advice from, especially if they claim to be a &ldquo;journalist expert‚Äù. This is not meant to criticize journalists in general. Some of these people do amazing work, sometimes risking their lives. And many are indeed experts in money and finance. But it appears that, at least in this space, there is not enough accountability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please check on your family members who might not be very, er, &ldquo;tech savvy&rdquo;. Particularly elderly relatives. Elderly people in English-speaking countries are particularly easy targets for these types of scams.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Jake Kepins has a great summary over on Threads about the &ldquo;expert journalist&rdquo; as well. Worth the read.
